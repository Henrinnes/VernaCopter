"""
one_shot_automatic.py

This script runs the system automatically in a "one-shot" mode without interactive user input. 
It uses predefined parameters and task descriptions for the selected scenario to generate and execute a trajectory.

The results, including system messages, task success, and waypoints, can be saved if specified in the parameters.

This mode is particularly useful for testing and benchmarking system performance.
